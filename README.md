These are my dotfiles. They work on macOS and Ubuntu

To use:
- install [zsh](http://www.zsh.org)
- clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`
- run the symlinking script: `./symlink`
- start a new Z shell
- if you're on linux run `dotfile_configure`
- restart your terminal

Pretty colors! Many goodies!

> Current Homebrew packages can be saved every now and then with `brew bundle dump --global --force`
