These are my dotfiles. They work on macOS and Ubuntu

To use:
- clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`
- run `dotfile_configure.sh`
- restart your terminal

Pretty colors! Many goodies!

> Current Homebrew packages can be saved every now and then with `brew bundle dump --global --force`

You can create a per-machine configs with the following files: 
- `~/.zshrc_local`
