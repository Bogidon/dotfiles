These are my dotfiles. They work on macOS and Ubuntu

To use:
- install [zsh](http://www.zsh.org)
- clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`
- symlink `zsh/.zshrc` and `zsh/.zshenv` to your home directory
- start a new Z shell
- if you're on linux run `dotfile_configure`
- restart your terminal

Pretty colors! Many goodies!
